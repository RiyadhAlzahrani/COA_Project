## __Requirement Programs:__
[Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/download.html) Update: 2013-04-29


Java 5 or later "to run `Logisim`

## __Project Task:__
Design using Logisim a single-cycle 32-bit CPU for a subset of the MIPS instructions, as detailed below. 
-  ALU instructions (R-type): add, sub
- Immediate instructions (I-type): addi 
- Load and Store (I-type): lw, sw 
- Branch (I-type): beq
- Jump (J-type): j

0. If didn't Open `logisim-win-2.7.1.exe` before, you need to download the latest Java Version if you don't have it already "just run the program to check "If you don't know if u have Java installed or not""
1. open `logisim-win-2.7.1.exe`
2. go to `File` > `Open...`
3. Select the `The Project of COE.circ` Then Click `Open`
4. Right Click on `Instuction Cache` unit Then `Load Image...`
5. Go to the Foulder `Test Files` then Select `Data in Instrution Cache` then click Open
6. Right Click on `Data Cache` unit Then `Load Image...`
7. Go to the Foulder `Test Files` then Select `Data in Cache Memory` then click Open
8. All set feel free to run our example u can try different things -HAVE FUN! üòÅ-
